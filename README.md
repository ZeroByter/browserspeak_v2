# browserspeak_v2
This a project to an application thats commonly called as the 'TeamSpeak 3' desktop program to the browser, no need to host a ts3 server and connecting to it from the browser, I mean an actual whole 'teamspeak like' websocket server run by 100% browser power.

# Is there voice communication for version 2?
Yes! It is very buggy and still is being worked on but generally it is somewhat working.

# Is there MySQL involved?
Yes, MySQL is used to store clients and channels of the server, turning on the server without setting up a MySQL connection or without having a database will cause the server to madly throw arrows at you and not work!

# Sounds cool! How can I help?
You can help by going over the code and helping comment on and post issues about anything from CSS bugs, code optimization, or more importantly secure fixes and improvements.

Happy chating!
